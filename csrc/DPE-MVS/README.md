## Dependencies
The code has been tested on Ubuntu 20.04 with Nvidia RTX 3090.

- [Cuda](https://developer.nvidia.cn/zh-cn/cuda-toolkit) >= 10.2
- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) >= 3.3.0
- [Boost](https://www.boost.org/) >= 1.62.0
- [cmake](https://cmake.org/) >= 2.8

**Besides make sure that your [GPU Compute Capability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA) matches the CMakeList.txt!!!** Otherwise you won't get the depth results! For example, according to [GPU Compute Capability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA), RTX3080's Compute Capability is 8.6. So you should set the cuda compilation parameter 'arch=compute_86,code=sm_86' or add a '-gencode arch=compute_86,code=sm_86'.

## Usage
- Compile
>
    mkdir build & cd build
    cmake ..
    make

- Test
>
    Use script colmap2mvsnet_acm.py to convert COLMAP SfM result to MVS input   
    Run ./DPE $data_folder to get reconstruction results.
    The result will be saved in the folder $data_folder/DPE, and the point cloud is saved as "DPE.ply"

If you need to filter out the sky during point cloud fusion, you can use a segmentation approach. Please refer to [MP-MVS](https://github.com/RongxuanTan/MP-MVS) and save the segmentation results in the $data_folder/blocks directory.
